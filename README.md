### Why?

There have been plenty NBA lineups that sounded amazing on paper,and still managed to have
completely underwhelming seasons. So much goes into an productive team that it's
easy to write these off as flukes, but maybe there's a simple derivative that
could've predicted which units had the potential to mesh and whether or
not any were doomed from the start.

### How?

I'm constructing the best offensive five man lineups using current
(2015 - 2016) starting players. Starting with the players with the highest offensive
efficiency, I'll create aggregate shot charts and determine which of the units have
the highest total percentage of floor coverage. I believe this may be the stongest metric of 
"spreading the floor" we can really quantify. Then I'll consider the most versatile 
as those with the greatest coverage and try to determine which aggregates also has the
highest scoring potential and efficiency based on data presented in the charts.

### Comparison 

Using the same exact method of building new and powerful teams I'll then rank those
that have been historically great -- including the past few championship winners and 
a few iconic teams. If the idea that comprehensive efficiency holds any weight
there's a chance that some of these teams might score pretty high. If not then we
know that the most important feature of any winning team is LeBron James.
